## Overview

### Description

- A flag game built using the [REST Countries API](https://www.restcountries.com/). 
- Players are shown an international flag and must select, from five choices, the country name which corresponds to the flag.
- After twenty rounds of this, players are shown their score out of twenty, and can choose to play again.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass custom properties
- REST Countries API
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
- Using setTimeout to control the flow of an app.

- I learned that adding a leaderboard to my game would require a backend. This is the first time that I encounter a simple, practical scenario in which I would need a back end to my app.

### Continued development

In the future, I will try to recreate this game with ReactJS.
